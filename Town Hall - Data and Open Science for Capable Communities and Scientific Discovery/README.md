### Purpose

For scientific communities to embrace and robustly and responsibly practice data science, including AI/ML, they require transdisciplinary communities of practice (CoP). We will explore developing, maintaining, and amplifying these CoPs by hearing from frontier thinkers that across different contexts (e.g., different science domains, different sectors of society). We will conclude with a discussion of how to begin building those CoPs this week at AGU. We will ground the discussion in the Earth and Space Sciences using the nascent Center for HelioAnalytics CoP, which will be using this discussion to determine their gathering activities across AGU 2022.
